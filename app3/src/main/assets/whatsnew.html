<h2>Welcome to Orpheus 3</h2>
<p>A lot has changed since Orpheus 2. In fact the entire app has been rewritten from scratch. Here are the highlights.</p>
<h4>Index</h4>
<h5>Library starts empty</h5>
<p>
    The first thing you will notice is that you have no music! Orpheus now manages its own index of music
    using an <b>exclusive</b> policy. So the <em>My Library</em> screen will not have any music in it
    to start with. You will need to browse through the available <em>Libraries</em> and add the folders
    where your music is stored. By clicking the <b>action button</b> with the <em>+</em> sign. After
    indexing the folder it can be removed from <em>My Library</em> by browsing back to the folder and
    clicking the same action button. (which will now have a <em>-</em> sign)
</p>
<h5>Why do in this way?</h5>
<p>
    The number one request we have received is folder black-listing. This is now
    implicitly supported. Don't want a folder in <em>My Library</em>? Just don't index it.
</p>
<p>
    Before only music stored on the sdcard would show in <em>My Library</em>.
    Now you can index any folder (from any Library plugin you have installed) and have
    it show in <em>My Library</em>. This is a major new feature in Orpheus 3.
</p>
<h5>How indexing works</h5>
<p>
    When you index a folder, Orpheus will recursively walk the hierarchy and read the ID3 tags for <b>every</b>
    audio file it finds. If your music does <b>not</b> have proper ID3 tags indexing will produce poor results.
    Indexing will <b>not</b> pull cover art from the ID3 tags; however, images in the same directory as the
    file named cover, artwork, or front will be used as cover art for that album.
    Also be mindful of indexing over metered connection (3G/LTE). Indexing will download somewhere between
    10-50% the total size of the folder. (Indexing A 100GB folder could download 50GB of data!).
</p>
<h5>Manual re-indexing</h5>
<p>
    Orpheus cannot automatically detect changes in your folders. You must manually rescan them
    by going to the <em>Folders</em> tab in <em>My Library</em>, long clicking the folder and
    pressing <em>Rescan</em> in the action menu. This will sync the <em>My Library</em> with any
    additions and deletions. This is normally very fast. (Auto rescan is on the todo list).
</p>
<h4>UI changes</h4>
<p>
    The ui has not changed very much since Orpheus 2 but there are some improvements.
</p>
<h5>Playback controls</h5>
<p>
    The playback controls are now in a <em>right</em> sliding drawer. To access them swipe from the right
    edge of the screen, or long press on the play button in the footer.
</p>
<h5>Footer</h5>
<p>
    You can now swipe left or right on the footer to move through the queue.
</p>
<h5>Now Playing</h5>
<p>
    The <em>Queue</em> and <em>Now Playing</em> screens have been merged into a single screen.
    Click anywhere on the footer to open it. The queue is a sliding drawer accessible by swiping
    from the <em>left</em> side of the screen or clicking the navigation button in the action bar.
</p>
<p>
    Now playing doubles as a car mode screen as well, you tell it to keep the screen on by selecting
    <em>Keep screen on</em> in the action bar menu.
</p>
<p>
    The visualizer (when enabled via the action bar menu), will now only show while music is playing
    and go back to showing artwork when paused. Note: If you are on Android M (6.0) and revoke
    the <em>Record Audio</em> permission, the visualizer will not work.
</p>
<h5>Overflow buttons</h5>
<p>
    The overflow buttons on the list items are gone in favor of an action mode. To enable
    long click on the list item. This allows performing operations on multiple items at
    once.
</p>
<h4>Playlists</h4>
<p>
    Orpheus now manages its own playlists of music in the index. Playlists from Orpheus 2 or
    other music players will not show up in the playlists screen. This was the only way to support
    playlists including music from multiple libraries. Which was not supported in Orpheus 2.
    You can still view and play read only copies of the old playlists from the <em>Android playlists</em>
    item in the folders library. (Better playlist integration is on the todo list)
</p>
<h4>Playback</h4>
<h5>Shuffle</h5>
<p>
    The ordinary shuffle mode is gone. Instead what we do is shuffle the queue then play it
    in order. This means once a queue is shuffled it cannot be 'unshuffled'.
</p>
<p>
    In addition shuffle is now <em>sticky</em>. After enabling shuffle mode, any new music
    you <em>enqueue</em> will be added, then the queue will be reshuffled. An important exception
    to this rule is the <em>play next</em> option, which will insert the items after the current
    position without shuffling them.
</p>
<h4>Chromecast</h4>
<p>
    The <em>Cast</em> button in the action bar is gone.
    To activate casting select <em>Set renderer</em> in the navigation drawer, then select
    <em>Chromecast</em>. This change is to allow additional renderers in the future. (such as
    UPNP, but no other renderers exist yet)
</p>
<p>
    Casting is only supported when connected to the same network as the chromecast. This is
    required because music stored on sdcard is streamed from the phone itself, and cloud
    sources (like Google Drive) are proxied through the phone. (Since the chromecast is not
    authorized to view the files). Remote media that does not require authentication (like UPNP)
    will stream from the source directly. Artwork is always served by the phone.
</p>
<h4>Last.FM</h4>
<p>
    Artist and album descriptions are now pulled and displayed in the details screens.
</p>
<p>
    External scrobblers are disabled by default. To enable the use of external scrobblers
    go to Settings -> Audio -> Broadcast meta. (This is what the BROADCAST_STICKY permission
    is used for). Internal scrobbling and loved tracks are on the todo list.
</p>
<h4>Translations</h4>
<p>
    Due to the drastic changes made in Orpheus 3 all translations have been
    removed. If you would like to translate Orpheus into your language of choice please email
    us using the <em>Send Feedback</em> option in settings.
</p>
<h4>Closing</h4>
<p>
    Thanks for reading. We hope you enjoy the new Orpheus. And sorry for the no frills intro.
