    <!-- Background colors for LetterTileDrawables. This set of colors is a subset of
    https://spec.googleplex.com/quantumpalette#extended which passes Google Accessibility
    Requirements for the color in question on white with >= 3.0 contrast. We used
    http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#white-on-%23db4437 to double-check the contrast.

    These colors are also used by MaterialColorMapUtils to generate primary activity colors.
